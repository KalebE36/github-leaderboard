# Github Leaderboard
This is a web service where users and sign up and race again their friends in repos. People would add a repo to their accounts and add users to track. Then github-leaderboard would generate graphs of user activity and calculate the winner from either the number of commits or lines of code written.

# Technology
We decided to write the backend in Python-Django, the database is Postgres, and the frontend is React. We are making use of Github Oath tokens for user authentication.
